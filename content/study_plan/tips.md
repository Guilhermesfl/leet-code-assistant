2. **Review Strategy**:
   - Revisit problems after 3 days, 1 week, 2 weeks
   - Keep a "mistakes journal"
   - Document patterns you discover

3. **Mock Interviews**:
   - Practice with Pramp, interviewing.io, or friends
   - Get comfortable with coding while talking
   - Practice on a whiteboard or Google Doc (not just IDE)

4. **Mental Health**:
   - Take one full rest day per week
   - Don't compare yourself to others
   - Celebrate small wins
   - It's okay to adjust the timeline if needed

5. **Going Beyond LeetCode**:
   - Read "Cracking the Coding Interview"
   - Study system design basics (even for junior roles)
   - Contribute to open source (builds talking points)
   - Work on a side project showcasing your skills
