# Caching Strategies

## Overview
Caching stores frequently accessed data in fast storage to reduce latency and load. It is used at multiple layers (client, server, database).

## Key Concepts
- Cache eviction policies (LRU, LFU, FIFO)
- Cache consistency
- Write-through, write-back, write-around
- Distributed caching

## Patterns & Techniques
- CDN for static assets
- In-memory caches (Redis, Memcached)
- Local vs global cache
- Cache invalidation strategies

## Example Interview Questions
- How would you design a caching layer for a web app?
- What are common cache eviction policies?
- How do you keep cache consistent with the database?

## Practice
- Design a cache for user sessions
- Explain cache invalidation in distributed systems
