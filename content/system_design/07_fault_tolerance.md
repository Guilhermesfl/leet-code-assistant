# Fault Tolerance

## Overview
Fault tolerance is the ability of a system to continue operating properly in the event of failures.

## Key Concepts
- Redundancy
- Circuit breakers
- Graceful degradation
- Failover mechanisms

## Patterns & Techniques
- Replication and backup
- Health checks and monitoring
- Retry logic
- Bulkheads and isolation

## Example Interview Questions
- How would you design a fault-tolerant system?
- What is graceful degradation?
- How do circuit breakers work?

## Practice
- Design a system that can survive server failures
- Explain how to monitor and recover from faults
