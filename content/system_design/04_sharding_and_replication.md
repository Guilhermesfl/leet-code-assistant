# Sharding & Replication

## Overview
Sharding splits data across multiple machines to improve scalability. Replication copies data to multiple machines for availability and fault tolerance.

## Key Concepts
- Leader/follower replication
- Partition keys
- Consistency models
- Failover strategies

## Patterns & Techniques
- Hash-based sharding
- Range-based sharding
- Synchronous vs asynchronous replication
- Read replicas

## Example Interview Questions
- How would you shard a large database?
- What are the trade-offs of replication?
- How do you handle failover in distributed systems?

## Practice
- Design a sharding strategy for user data
- Explain replication in a high-availability system
