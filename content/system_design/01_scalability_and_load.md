# Scalability & Load

## Overview
Scalability is the ability of a system to handle increased load by adding resources. Load refers to the amount of work a system must process (requests, data, users).

## Key Concepts
- Horizontal vs vertical scaling
- Throughput vs latency
- Bottlenecks and load balancing
- Capacity planning

## Patterns & Techniques
- Stateless services for easy scaling
- Caching to reduce repeated work
- Sharding and partitioning
- Auto-scaling groups

## Example Interview Questions
- How would you scale a web application to handle 10x traffic?
- What is the difference between throughput and latency?
- How do you identify bottlenecks in a distributed system?

## Practice
- Design a system that can scale to millions of users
- Explain how you would handle sudden traffic spikes
