# Messaging & Queues

## Overview
Messaging systems and queues decouple producers and consumers, enabling asynchronous communication and load smoothing.

## Key Concepts
- Pub/Sub vs point-to-point queues
- Message ordering and delivery guarantees
- Retries and dead-letter queues
- Event-driven architecture

## Patterns & Techniques
- Kafka, RabbitMQ, SQS
- At-least-once vs exactly-once delivery
- Fan-out and fan-in patterns
- Message deduplication

## Example Interview Questions
- How would you design a messaging system for microservices?
- What are dead-letter queues?
- How do you ensure message ordering?

## Practice
- Design a queue for processing background jobs
- Explain event-driven architecture in a real system
