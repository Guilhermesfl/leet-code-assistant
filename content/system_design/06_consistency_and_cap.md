# Consistency & CAP

## Overview
Consistency ensures all nodes see the same data at the same time. The CAP theorem states a distributed system can only guarantee two of Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance.

## Key Concepts
- Strong vs eventual consistency
- CAP theorem
- Trade-offs in distributed systems
- Partition tolerance

## Patterns & Techniques
- Quorum-based writes
- Read-after-write consistency
- Conflict resolution
- Eventual consistency models

## Example Interview Questions
- What is the CAP theorem?
- How do you achieve consistency in distributed systems?
- What is eventual consistency?

## Practice
- Design a system with strong consistency
- Explain trade-offs between consistency and availability
