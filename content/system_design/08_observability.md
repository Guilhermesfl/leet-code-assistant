- Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack
- Health dashboards
- Trace context propagation

## Example Interview Questions
- How would you monitor a distributed system?
- What is the difference between metrics and logs?
- How do you implement tracing?

## Practice
- Design a dashboard for system health
- Explain how to debug production issues using observability tools
