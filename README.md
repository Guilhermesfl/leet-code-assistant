# LeetCode Interview Preparation Assistant

A structured system for preparing for FAANG interviews with 150 curated LeetCode problems, organized for progressive learning with spaced repetition.

## 📁 Folder Structure

```
leet-code-assistant/
├── README.md                 # This file
├── problem_list.md          # Curated list of 150 problems in sequence
├── solutions/               # Your solutions with reasoning notes
├── optimal_solutions/       # Optimal solutions with complexity analysis
├── data_structures/         # Theory and reference for data structures
└── python_docs/            # Python-specific techniques for LeetCode
```

## 🔄 Workflow

1. **Choose a problem**: Follow the sequence in `problem_list.md` (starts easy, gradually increases difficulty)
2. **Solve on LeetCode**: Work through the problem on the LeetCode platform
3. **Document your solution**: Open the corresponding file in `solutions/` (e.g., `001_two_sum.py`)
4. **Add your reasoning**: Fill in the `# Notes:` section explaining your thought process and approach
5. **Paste your code**: Add your solution code below the notes
6. **Request feedback**: Ask me to review your solution - I'll guide you to improve without giving away the answer
7. **Compare with optimal**: Once you've reached an optimal solution (or want to learn), check `optimal_solutions/` for the best approach with complexity analysis

## 📝 Solution File Format

Each file in `solutions/` has this structure:

```python
# Notes: [Explain your reasoning, approach, and thought process here]

# Problem: [Problem Title]

# Solution:
# [Your code goes here]
```

## 🎯 Learning Approach

- **Progressive difficulty**: Start with easy problems, gradually introduce medium and hard
- **Topic mixing**: Concepts like hash maps, two pointers, trees, DP reappear periodically for reinforcement
- **Spaced repetition**: Related problems are distributed throughout the list to strengthen learning
- **Guided feedback**: I help you identify issues and optimize solutions without spoiling the answer

## 📚 Reference Materials

- **`data_structures/`**: Core concepts with time/space complexity and use cases
- **`python_docs/`**: Python-specific patterns, idioms, and built-in functions for competitive programming

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Open `problem_list.md` to see all 150 problems
2. Start with Problem #1
3. Follow the workflow above
4. Reference documentation as needed

Good luck with your interview preparation! 🎉
